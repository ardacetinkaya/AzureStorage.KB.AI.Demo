# Fellow

Welcome to **Fellow**! 🚀

This is a learning playground designed to explore how to build AI-enhanced applications using the .NET platform and Azure services. The goal is to understand how to integrate custom data into AI chat experiences, making them smarter and more context-aware.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this repository is to learn and experiment with:
- **.NET APIs** for AI development.
- **Azure AI Search** for indexing and retrieving custom data.
- Building a **Chat Interface** that can "talk" to your documents.

It's a "work in progress" because learning is a never-ending journey! 🌟

## 📂 What's Inside?

The project is split into two main parts:

- **`Fellow.Services`**: The backend brain. It handles data ingestion, reading documents (like PDFs), and managing the "knowledge" that the AI uses.
- **`Fellow.Web.UI`**: The frontend interface. A web-based chat application where you can interact with the AI.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **.NET**
- **Azure AI Search**
- **Blazor** (Web UI)
